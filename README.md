### Introduction:
PROJECT HAKAI V2.0(Formerly known as "PROJECT-03") is a security project focused on autonomous intelligence collection and distribution.

**NOTE**: No one is allowed to (re)publish, (re-)distribute, modify, clone or otherwise share the code to anyone at any given time. I will **NEVER** publish the source code, snippets, overviews or other bits of code here on GitHub or any other platform. Due to the potential privacy concerns, I will **NOT** share builds or access to individuals, groups or teams with vague, malicious, unclear or other intent that I deem unsafe. &copy; 2024 - 2025, All rights reserved. 

### Crisis Vision
Crisis vision (CVision) is an autonomous security drone that is focused on intel collection and perimeter overwatch in areas that are small or otherwise hard to reach for humans. Equipped with facial recognition, military-grade encryption, remote control, this drone can offer security quickly and effectively almost anywhere.

### P7077
P7077 is a one-way encrypted communication network. Aimed to provide essential intel across teams and personnel in real time. Offering backup protocols to re-collect missed intel, this network can make sure you retrieve any necessary or urgent information even after a shutdown, loss of contact or other unexpected behavior.

### TMap
ThreatMap (TMap) serves as an extension to [Crisis Vision](#crisis-vision). Showcasing, logging and alerting any user of detected threats, their geo-location and other essential information in real-time to keep the situation under control and even give users not actively at the location insight into what is going at the drone's location.

### MCenter
The Mobile Center (MCenter) serves as a remote control endpoint for all of PROJECT HAKAI. Allowing active monitoring of all of PROJECT HAKAI's tools and running devices.
Some (But not all) monitor data includes:
- Device status
- Statistics
- Control options

And more. 

### BioAccess [WIP]
BioAccess is an Access Control system that allows personnel to "unlock" or gain access to devices/doors/any physical matter secured by it by completing a two-step security check, requiring both facial data and biometric data (fingerprints).
This can be paired with [Crisis Vision](#crisis-vision) or ran on it's own.  All access is logged and checks can both be ran locally or over the net depending on the use case. Multiple security measures are put in place to prevent unauthorized duplication of "authorized" users, such as but not limited to:
- Military grade encryption
- Hashing 
- Protected data storing.


### Additional notes:
- Due to the sensitive information this project collects, I will only provide access to the builds (not source code) as I deem fit.
