### Introduction:
PROJECT HAKAI (Formerly known as "PROJECT-03") is a security focused toolset and TAK (Tactical Awareness Kit) project. Aiming to provide a technical advantage on the field for teams, groups or individuals and to give them an extra edge to latch on to.

**NOTE**: No one is allowed to (re)publish, re-distribute, modify, clone or otherwise share the code to anyone at any given time. I will **NEVER** publish the source code, snippets, overviews or other bits of information here on GitHub or any other platform. Due to the potential privacy concerns, I will **NOT** share builds or access to individuals, groups or teams with vague, malicious, unclear or other intent that I deem unsafe. &copy; 2024 - 2025, All rights reserved. 

### Crisis Vision
Crisis vision (CVision) is an autonomous security drone that is focused on intel collection and perimeter overwatch in areas that are small or otherwise hard to reach for humans. Equipped with facial recognition, efficient code and security measures, this drone can offer security quickly and effectively almost anywhere.

### P7077
P7077 is a one-way encrypted communication network. Aimed to provide essential intel or information across teams and personnel in real time. Offering backup protocols to re-collect missed intel, this network can make sure you retrieve any necessary or urgent information even after a shutdown, loss of contact or other unexpected behavior.

### TMap
ThreatMap (Mmap) serves as an extension to [Crisis Vision](#crisis-vision). Showcasing, logging and alerting any user of detected threats, their geo-location and other essential information in real-time to keep the situation under control and even give users not actively at the location insight into what is going at the drone's location.

### MCenter
The Mobile Center (MCenter) serves as a remote control endpoint for all of PROJECT HAKAI. Allowing active monitoring of all of PROJECT HAKAI's tools and running devices.
Some (But not all) monitor data includes:
- Uptime
- Geo location of all devices
- Last active event
- Device status

And more. 


### Additional notes:
- More projects and features will come soon as I'm actively working on it.
- Due to the sensitive information this project collects, I will only provide access to the builds (not source code) as I deem fit.
