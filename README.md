## HakaiVision
HakaiVision  is an light weight autonomous threat detection system.
It is aimed to provide both access control and perimeter over watch by utilizing a wide range of tech and can easily be adapted to work alongside other pre-existing tools. 

Some features include:
- Facial recognition
- Data obfuscation and encryption
- Machine learning 
- Alerting system
- GPS coordinate tracking system

and more. But for now, this is the only spec list I wish to release publicly.

## HakaiTMAP
HakaiTMAP is an extension to HakaiVision and serves as the monitor for it all. Mapping out individual threats or "Detections" by utilizing data retrieved from HakaiVision in real time.

## HakaiComm
HakaiComm is a one-way encrypted information and alerting system. Aimed to dispatch essential information towards squads in a secure and "No bullshit" way. Messages are encrypted and no client will store messages. If for some reason one client falls out of reach of the control server, shuts down or otherwise is unable to retrieve messages. It will be able to re-retrieve missed messages upon reboot as long as a connection is able to be made to the control server.

## HakaiMCenter [WIP]
HakaiMCenter is a mobile lightweight system monitor that can be setup in a matter of seconds. Providing remote controls for all projects, view status and precise geo-locations of all devices utilized by PROJECT HAKAI.
